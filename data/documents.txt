What is CNCF?

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is an open-source software foundation dedicated to advancing cloud-native technologies. CNCF projects help developers and organizations build scalable, flexible, and modern applications.

Core Principles of Cloud-Native Computing

•	Containerization: Applications are packaged as containers for easy deployment and portability.
•	Microservices: Applications are built as loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
•	Dynamic Orchestration: Tools like Kubernetes automate deployment, scaling, and management of containers.
•	Declarative APIs: Infrastructure and application behavior are described through declarative configurations.

Popular CNCF Projects

1.	Kubernetes
•	Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
•	Use Case: Managing large-scale distributed systems.
•	Key Features:
•	Self-healing (reschedules failed containers).
•	Auto-scaling (adjust resources based on demand).
•	Service discovery and load balancing.
2.	Prometheus
•	Prometheus is a monitoring system and time-series database designed for cloud-native environments.
•	Use Case: Collecting metrics and generating alerts for systems running in Kubernetes clusters.
•	Key Features:
•	Query language (PromQL).
•	Visualization with Grafana.
•	Alerts for system performance issues.
3.	Envoy
•	Envoy is a high-performance service proxy designed for cloud-native microservices architectures.
•	Use Case: Load balancing, observability, and API gateway in microservice applications.
•	Key Features:
•	Traffic shaping.
•	Advanced observability.
•	Protocol support (HTTP/2, gRPC).
4.	Helm
•	Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies application deployment.
•	Use Case: Managing Kubernetes manifests using reusable Helm Charts.
•	Key Features:
•	Chart templates for faster deployment.
•	Rollback functionality.
5.	Linkerd
•	Linkerd is a service mesh for Kubernetes that provides observability, reliability, and security.
•	Use Case: Managing communication between microservices in a Kubernetes cluster.
•	Key Features:
•	Mutual TLS for service communication.
•	Lightweight proxy.
6.	Argo
•	Argo is a suite of tools for Kubernetes, including Argo Workflows, Argo CD, and Argo Rollouts.
•	Use Case: Managing CI/CD pipelines and workflows.
•	Key Features:
•	Declarative GitOps for deployment.
•	Rollout strategies for updates.
7.	OpenTelemetry
•	OpenTelemetry provides observability through distributed tracing, metrics, and logs.
•	Use Case: Monitoring applications across distributed systems.
•	Key Features:
•	Vendor-agnostic instrumentation.
•	Support for multiple programming languages.
